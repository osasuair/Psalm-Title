# Psalm-Title
This program is used to demonstrate Searching Algorithms in Python.

This program reads 50 Psalms from the Psalm Text file into an array. The user can then request a Psalm number to find the title of the psalm. 
Using a binary search the user selected psalm is found. If the Psalm number is not found in the file, it will display an appropriate message 
telling the user it was not found.
